title: Industry leaders explain the benefits of contributing to open source
---

Contributing to open source is still relatively uncommon, even in the tech industry itself.
Yet the companies who have built a strong open source culture really have an edge over those that don't.

Here are a few industry leaders explaining some of the benefits of building a strong open source culture:

## A catalyst for innovation

> "We believe in the power of communities
to achieve more together than what their members can do on their own,
and that collaborative development through the open source process can accelerate innovation."

—Satya Nadella, CEO, Microsoft

> "In today's world of fast-paced internet services deployment,
owning IP has become considerably less important
than turning research results into innovative products as quickly as possible,
and deploying them at scale."

—Yann LeCun, Director of AI Research, Facebook, and Founding Director, NYU Center for Data Science

> "Open source really helps us on two fronts: one is costs and the other is speed.
>
> On the cost front, if we were to approach software in a closed manner we'd get saddled with all the lifecycle costs from birth to death of that software project. But if we're able to put it into open source, and show how others can take advantage and use it, we actually share the costs, and we get their innovation.
> 
> Now where the speed comes in, is where we get others to help collaborate and advance that software for us; not just for their needs, but for our needs as well. So it really helps us on cost and speed."

—Andre Fuetsch, CTO, AT&T, and President, AT&T Labs

## Recruiting and retaining talent

> "We know that this recruiting angle works.
3/4 of our new engineers say that our open source program
positively affected their decision to join the company."

—James Pearce, Head of the Open Source Program, Facebook.

> "Open source helps us retain and attract talent.
People, the new generation especially,
get their street creds from submitting to open source."

—Tom Soderstrom CTO/CIO for IT, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA

> "In order to keep a killer developer happy,
you have to help them become more attractive to other employers.
But that’s ok, because that’s exactly the kind of developer you want to have working for you.
So relax and let them work on open source or they’ll go somewhere else where they can."

—Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder and ex-CEO, GitHub

## Technology leadership

> "Technology leadership is not defined by patents […]
but rather by the ability of a company to attract and motivate the world’s most talented engineers.
We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents
will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla’s position in this regard."

—Elon Musk, CEO, Tesla
